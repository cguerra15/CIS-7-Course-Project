# CIS-7-Course-Project
Project Description
This project is a C++ implementation of the Vignere Cipher. The program was developed as part of my CIS-7 Course to demonstrate practical application of modular arithmetic in cyptography.
This tool allows users to secure messages by shifting letters based on a repeating keyword, making it significantly more secure than a standard Caesar cipher.

Programming Approaches
Unlike traditional implmentations using a memory heavy 26x26 lookup table, this program utilizes an Algebraic Implmentation on modular arithmetic.

Instructions
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   Select Mode: Enter 1 to Encrypt or 2 to Decrypt
   Enter Message: Input your text in UPPERCASE (no spaces/numbers).
   Enter Key: Input your keyword in UPPERCASE.
